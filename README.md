> Identify the algorithm behind a hash string by its prefix, length, and character set — the first move in any password-cracking workflow.

*This is a quick overview — security theory, architecture, and full walkthroughs are in the [learn modules](#learn).*

> [!NOTE]
> **Foundations tier** — this project is built for someone who has never written Python before. The source code is heavily commented as a teaching aid, the `learn/` folder explains every concept from zero, and the whole tool is one readable file. If you already know Python, jump straight to [`PROJECTS/beginner/hash-cracker`](../../beginner/hash-cracker) — the natural cracking companion to this identifier.

## What It Does

- Identify ~30 hash formats by prefix (`$2b$`, `$argon2id$`, `$apr1$`, `pbkdf2_sha256$`, `{SSHA}`, and more)
- Identify common hex hashes by length (MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-512, NTLM, MD4, RIPEMD, BLAKE2, SHA-3)
- Recognize MySQL5, NetNTLMv1/v2, and traditional 13-char DES crypt by shape
- Detect non-hash inputs (JWTs, base64 blobs) and tell the user what they actually pasted
- Return ranked candidates with `high` / `medium` / `low` confidence and a one-line *reason* for every guess
- Pure-function core — no network, no filesystem, no global state, instant runtime
- Rich-rendered colored output table; clean exit codes for shell scripting

## Quick Start

```bash
./install.sh
just run -- 5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99
# ✔ MD5 (medium) — 32 hex chars, most likely candidate at this length
```

> [!TIP]
> This project uses [`just`](https://github.com/casey/just) as a command runner. Type `just` to see all available commands.
>
> Install: `curl -sSf https://just.systems/install.sh | bash -s -- --to ~/.local/bin`

## Demo Hashes

Try these — each demonstrates a different identification path:

| Hash | Detected as | Why |
|------|-------------|-----|
| `5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99` | MD5 | 32 hex chars — most likely candidate at this length |
| `e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855` | SHA-256 | 64 hex chars — most likely candidate at this length |
| `$2b$12$EixZaYVK1fsbw1ZfbX3OXePaWxn96p36WQNQy.uK4Of2T7G.VHvgvWK` | bcrypt | prefix `$2b$` — bcrypt PHC string, 2b variant (current) |
| `$argon2id$v=19$m=65536,t=3,p=4$c29tZXNhbHQ$RdescudvJCsgt3ub+b+dWRWJTmaaJObG` | Argon2id | prefix `$argon2id$` — modern PHC string, the current standard |
| `$apr1$JlOdSlVe$ipa1mTAv3LFRBHHzqaIaH/` | Apache MD5-crypt | prefix `$apr1$` — Apache htpasswd MD5 variant (`htpasswd -m`) |
| `*A4B6157319038724E3560894F7F932C8886EBFCF` | MySQL5 | starts with `*` followed by 40 uppercase hex chars |
| `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIn0.dozjgN...` | JWT (not a hash) | leading `eyJ` is base64 of `{"` — JWT, not a hash |

```bash
just run -- 5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99
just run -- '$2b$12$EixZaYVK1fsbw1ZfbX3OXePaWxn96p36WQNQy.uK4Of2T7G.VHvgvWK'
just run -- '*A4B6157319038724E3560894F7F932C8886EBFCF'
just run -- e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Always wrap hashes that begin with `$` in **single quotes**. Without quotes your shell will try to expand `$2`, `$P$`, `$1$` etc. as shell variables and silently mangle the input.

## Tooling

```bash
just            # list available recipes
just test       # run pytest (30+ tests, runs in under a second)
just lint       # ruff + mypy --strict + pylint
just format     # yapf
just run -- <h> # identify a hash
```

## Requirements

- **Python 3.14+** — the install script will check.
- [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) — modern Python package manager (auto-installed by `./install.sh`).
- [`just`](https://github.com/casey/just) — command runner (auto-installed by `./install.sh`).

No compilers, no system libraries, no network access required. The project is one Python file plus tests.

## Learn

This project includes step-by-step learning materials covering security theory, architecture, and implementation — written for someone who has never touched Python before.
