Tests for hash_identifier — focused on the most-relied-on cases

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
What "tests" are and why we write them
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
A test is a tiny Python function that calls our real code with a
known input and then ASSERTS that the result is what we expected.
If the assertion fails, pytest prints a red FAIL message — which
means we changed something and broke a behavior we cared about

Tests are insurance. The first time you write the code, the test
just confirms it works. But six months later when you refactor or
add a new feature, the existing tests catch any accidental breakage.
This is why every senior codebase has tests: not because the code is
hard to write, but because the code is hard to keep WORKING over time

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The shape of a pytest test
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  def test_<what_we_are_checking>() -> None:
      result = some_function(some_input)
      assert result == expected

Three rules
  1. The function name must start with `test_` — pytest only collects
     functions that match that pattern
  2. The function takes no arguments (unless using fixtures)
  3. Use the `assert` keyword to declare what should be true. If the
     condition is false, the test fails

We follow the "Arrange-Act-Assert" structure inside each test
  - Arrange: set up inputs (the `sample = ...` line)
  - Act:     call the real code (`candidates = identify(sample)`)
  - Assert:  check the result (`assert candidates[0]...`)

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Coverage strategy
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
We do NOT try to test every algorithm in the table — that would be
hundreds of nearly identical tests. Instead we exercise each BRANCH
of identify() at least once

  - prefix matches (one bcrypt, one Argon2id, one Django, one crypt)
  - special MySQL5 format
  - hex length matches (MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256 lengths)
  - the empty / garbage / whitespace fallbacks
  - HashCandidate's immutability

Together these give us confidence that every code path runs without
explosion, and that the most-common inputs produce the expected
top-ranked candidate

# Importing from `hash_identifier` (NOT `hash_identifier.py`) tells
# Python to load the module that lives in this same directory. We
# pull in three things:
#   - `identify`     — the function under test
#   - `HashCandidate`— the return-type dataclass (used in the
#                      immutability test)
#   - `PREFIX_RULES` — the prefix lookup table (used by the
#                      parametrized "every row is covered" test
#                      at the bottom of this file)
# `pytest` is also imported so we can use the @pytest.mark.parametrize
# decorator to expand one test function into many test cases
# Third-party: the test runner itself. We also need it imported here
# so we can use its `@pytest.mark.parametrize` decorator below.
